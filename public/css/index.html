    <h1 id="www">1.How can you improve yourself?</h1>
    <h4 id="n">Next, start looking at what you see going on around you: the people, the trees, 
    the billboards, the shop windows.Now, turn your attention to sounds. Don’t get 
    caught up in thinking about objects, just be aware of them as you pass by.
    Smell comes next. Note how the mind wants to create a story out of each smell.
     Notice any physical sensations. Perhaps it’s the feeling of warm sunshine, 
    the soles of your feet touching the ground, or your bad knee flaring up again.
     Pay attention to feelings that come up. For instance, what happens when your 
     rhythm is broken by a red light? And when the light turns green, do you speed up
    to pass that man on your left? Don’t judge yourself—just notice your thoughts and let them go.</h4>
   <h1 id="z">7. Take a coffee break with a friend.</h1> 
    <h4 id="mmm">Socializing is not only a pleasant way to spend time, it’s actually good for your brain. Lighthearted, friendly conversation has cognitive benefits.
    Studies have found that talking and socializing can make it easier for us to solve problems. But remember to play nice with others -- conversations that are competitive or aggressive have no such benefits.
    Researchers have found that engaging in just 10 minutes of conversation boosted people’s performance on common cognitive tasks. So taking a quick coffee break with a friend can give you a competitive edge when you go back to work.

    <h1 id="x">7. Take a coffee break with a friend.</h1>
    <h4 id="j">Going outside and stretching your legs for just 10 minutes is enough to improve brain function, concentration and focus. A walk can ease depression, improve bone health, reduce stress and promote a healthy heart.
    Spending just 10 minutes a day outside may also be key to helping your body absorb the necessary amount of vitamin D it needs. It turns out that vitamin D can be hard for our bodies to absorb just from eating well. We actually get 80 to 90 percent of our vitamin D from the sun.
    But spending too much time outside without sunscreen isn’t good either, and can lead to sun-damaged skin. A 10-minute break outside will help you get what you need from the sun without doing any harm.</h4>
    
    <h1 id="c">9. Set yourself up to be successful tomorrow.</h1>
    <h4 id="k">Your last 10 minutes of the work day are crucial for setting yourself up for a productive tomorrow. Before you leave for the night, take a few minutes and go through your day’s to-do list -- did you finish everything or are there items that need to be moved to the next day?
    Do a quick brain dump -- write down all the things that are clogging up your mind; all the nitty-gritty details you want to remember for things you’re working on. Use that brain dump organize and prioritize tomorrow’s to-do list.
    Finish by signing out of email and taking a moment to organize and tidy up your desk and workspace. Ta-da! You’re done for the day, and you have a head start on tomorrow.</h4>
    
    <h1 id="v">9. Set yourself up to be successful tomorrow.</h1>
    <h4 id="l">Get yourself in the right frame of mind for sleep by spending the last 10 minutes before bed writing in your journal. Simply report to yourself what you did that day. If your handwriting is hard to read, try keeping a journal on your computer.
    However you decide to journal, make sure you accurately and honestly share how your day went, your wins and losses. This will give your day a sense of closure and help you process all that went on.
    As you look back on your day, what could you have done differently? Ten minutes of introspection will help you learn and grow from your experiences. Finish by writing what you hope to see happen tomorrow, making sure you stay optimistic and positive.</h4>
